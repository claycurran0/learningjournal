#### **Using the Generator**
Scaffold is a rails generator that can be used to build the entire CRUD (create, read, update, delete) infrastructure with a single line of code in the command terminal. This will save us countless hours and eliminate typos when building new rails applications or adding new data sets to the database.

To run the scaffold generator for "movies", simply run the following code in the terminal:

''''ruby
Some code
''''
