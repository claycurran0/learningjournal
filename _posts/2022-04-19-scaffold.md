#### **Using the Generator**
Scaffold is a rails generator that can be used to build the entire CRUD (create, read, update, delete) infrastructure with a single line of code in the command terminal. This will save us countless hours and eliminate typos when building new rails applications or adding new data sets to the database.

To run the scaffold generator for "movies", simply run the following code in the terminal:


`rails generate scaffold movie title:string description:text`

Voila! Just like that, rails generates the database model, basic CRUD infrastructure through routes and controller actions, and basic view templates to create, view, update, and delete movies in the database. 

You might notice that, in the routes file, rails only generated a single line of code:

````ruby
resources: movies
````

This single line of code actually represents 7 individual basic routes that make up the basic CRUD application. If you wrote these out by hand, they'd look like this: 

````ruby
  # CREATE
  post "/movies" => "movies#create", as: :movies
  get "/movies/new" => "movies#new", as: :new_movie
          
  # READ
  get "/movies" => "movies#index"
  get "/movies/:id" => "movies#show", as: :movie
  
  # UPDATE
  patch "/movies/:id" => "movies#update"
  get "/movies/:id/edit" => "movies#edit", as: :edit_movie
  
  # DELETE
  delete "/movies/:id" => "movies#destroy"
  #------------------------------
````

So, we saved a lot of time but the tradeoff is interpretability and clarity in our code. Shortcuts like this are powerful, but can lead to unwanted view templates and actions which could lead to security holes in our application - so it's important to fully understand the "unseen" code and understand its consequences.
